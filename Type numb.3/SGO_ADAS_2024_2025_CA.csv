The driver was following a box truck driven by her fiancee. The customer further stated that the vehicle was traveling through a section of highway where a cement divider was close to the lane of travel and that the ""wheel jerked"". The vehicle struck the divider with the left rear wheel and the vehicle then crossed to the right side of the highway and struck a wall. The customer was unable to state in which direction the wheel had jerked. The customer stated that the vehicle was beeping but the driver was not looking at the dashboard when the incident was occurring. There were no airbags deployed, and the customer reportedly sustained minor injuries. The subject vehicle was reportedly towed from the scene.
Subaru inspected the subject vehicle on 3/25/2025. Carfax and repair records indicated the vehicle had recently been involved in a previous incident on 1/08/2025 where the inner and outer tie-rods were damaged. Repairs included an alignment and EyeSight camera recalibration. As related to this incident, there was accident damage to the rear left suspension, wheel, wheel opening garnish, and bumper cover. The front bumper cover, grille, and right headlight were also damaged.
[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
Based on the vehicle inspection and the data acquired, Subaru determined that there were no abnormalities with the ACC or LCF systems. The roadway was curving to the right, but the steering input was almost neutral [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]. LCF was not engaged and there were no abrupt steering changes left or right prior to initial impact [REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]. The data indicated there was no driver steering input until after the first impact.",Y

According to the telematics data from the vehicle, at 9:21:25 p.m. a notification via driver display for high curvature warning was activated due to the vehicle detecting a curve in the highway. The notification was on for almost 10 seconds. At 9:21:54 p.m., the driver overrode Highway Assist by applying a steering torque of 4.2Nm, which transitioned the vehicle into Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). The driver notification was activated, which should have alerted the driver to the transition from HWA to ACC. The vehicle then proceeded in a forward path with minimal steering input (less than 1.6Nm) until accelerometer data shows the vehicle came into contact with an object at 9:22:15 p.m. PT. The vehicle then came to a full rest moments later. Rivian believes that the driver failing to take control of the vehicle after he cancelled HWA was the cause of the crash and neither vehicle systems nor performance were factors in the crash.",

The customer noted the conditions as being dark. The customer further stated that as the roadway curved to the right, the system ""shut off"" and the vehicle climbed the curb to the left, entering a vegetated median strip. The vehicle then rolled several times, struck a tree and came to rest in the opposing lanes of traffic. The frontal and curtain airbags deployed, and the vehicle was towed from the scene.
[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
Subaru inspected the subject vehicle on 1/7/2025. The odometer reading was 5,003. In addition to rollover damage, extensive damage was found to the front right suspension, and the front right wheel was bent inward at the center of the wheel barrel. The front right tire was flat and had sustained impact damage. The front left tire had a cut on the outer sidewall but still held air pressure.
[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
The incident occurred approximately 0.1 miles from an intersection controlled by a traffic signal. It is a three-lane asphalt surface approaching a right-hand curve. The roadway lane markings were noted as being faded and in need of repainting, but there were no other abnormalities.
Based on the inspection and the data acquired, Subaru determined that there were no abnormalities with the ADAS systems. The customer had alleged that the system had ""shut off"" just prior to the impact with the center median. However, the vehicle data indicated that the ACC was cancelled by the driver's application of the brake pedal. Subaru was not able to confirm whether the LCF was engaged, but it would have disengaged simultaneous to the cancellation of the ACC.",Y

The driver maintains that the vehicle slowed down as it approached a Toyota Corolla which was stopped at a traffic light. A Chevrolet Trailblazer was also at the traffic light immediately in front of the Corolla. 
[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] the driver manually applied the brakes to ensure that the vehicle came to a complete stop. The vehicle nonetheless struck the rear of the Toyota Corolla, which in turn struck the rear of the Chevrolet Trailblazer. At the time of the incident there were no injuries reported and no airbags deployed. Since that time, Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA) has been informed that there may be minor injuries. All three vehicles were towed from the scene. Law enforcement arrived but confirmed that there would be no Police Accident Report as there were no injuries reported at the scene. 
MBUSA initiated an inspection of the vehicle on December 4.  The Event Data Recorder (EDR) was imaged.  An initial review of the EDR data does not indicate the application of the service brakes, nor any ABS or ESC activation during the 5 seconds before the crash. The EDR data does indicate 12% accelerator pedal input throughout the 5 seconds prior to the crash.
MBUSA's investigation into this incident continues.
1/15/2025 Update to 855-9284-1:
MBUSA initiated a further inspection of the vehicle on December 6, 2024, which included general diagnostics and an inspection of both the acceleration and braking systems. This inspection revealed no evidence of any steering or braking malfunctions and the available information indicates both systems operated as intended at the time of the incident. MBUSA has concluded its investigation into this matter.",Y

The driver maintains that the vehicle slowed down as it approached a Toyota Corolla which was stopped at a traffic light. A Chevrolet Trailblazer was also at the traffic light immediately in front of the Corolla. 
[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION] the driver manually applied the brakes to ensure that the vehicle came to a complete stop. The vehicle nonetheless struck the rear of the Toyota Corolla, which in turn struck the rear of the Chevrolet Trailblazer. At the time of the incident there were no injuries reported and no airbags deployed. Since that time, Mercedes-Benz USA (MBUSA) has been informed that there may be minor injuries. All three vehicles were towed from the scene. Law enforcement arrived but confirmed that there would be no Police Accident Report as there were no injuries reported at the scene. 
MBUSA initiated an inspection of the vehicle on December 4.  The Event Data Recorder (EDR) was imaged.  An initial review of the EDR data does not indicate the application of the service brakes, nor any ABS or ESC activation during the 5 seconds before the crash. The EDR data does indicate 12% accelerator pedal input throughout the 5 seconds prior to the crash.
MBUSA's investigation into this incident continues.",Y

The police report indicates the subject vehicle was towed.
On July [XXX], 2024, a 2024 Chevrolet Traverse was traveling north on [XXX] in Nipton, California with Super Cruise engaged and active.  Crash data indicates a rollover event.  According to telematics data, the driver's seatbelt was unbuckled  approximately 14 seconds before the crash initiating a Super Cruise escalation take over request to the driver.  A Super Cruise state of Disabled/Not Ready was also recorded 13 seconds prior to the crash indicating a driver takeover of the vehicle.  The vehicle's roof rail air bags and seat belt pretensioners deployed.  The vehicle was traveling approximately 75 mph 14 seconds prior to the crash.  The driver was not wearing his seatbelt at the time of the crash and was ejected from the vehicle.  According to the OnStar audio recordings, the wife of the driver was following the subject vehicle at the time of the incident.  She communicated that the driver had a possible broken arm and lacerations to the head and that she was going to transport the driver to a medical facility for treatment.

The customer had just set the adaptive cruise control (ACC) to 70 MPH and that lane centering (LCF) was engaged. The traffic was described as steady. As the subject vehicle approached an accident scene in the same lane of travel, the vehicle in front came to a sudden stop. The customer stated that she applied the brake pedal and turned the steering wheel to the right but impacted the vehicle in front on the right-side rear bumper. The frontal airbags deployed upon impact and the subject vehicle then left the roadway. The vehicle subsequently caught fire and was towed from the scene. There were no injuries reported.
[REDACTED, MAY CONTAIN CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION]
Based on the customer's statements and the available data, Subaru determined that there were no abnormalities with the ACC or LCF systems. The data indicated that the ACC system first activated vehicle braking, followed by AEB, prior to the customer applying any effective braking. Per the owner's manual, there are limits to the situational judgment capabilities of the ACC system. The system cannot predict  a vehicle in front unexpectedly decelerating or suddenly braking.",Y

ACC is not a level 2 ADAS system, but Rivian is submitting this report because there was some uncertainty in the verbal complaint about whether the driver was allegedly using ACC or Highway Assist (HWA), which is a level 2 feature. The driver initially reported that they were using ACC, but the Rivian call center mistakenly assumed HWA was activated and noted it as such. However, vehicle telematics data demonstrates that HWA was not active during the crash or in the 30 seconds prior to this crash and that ACC was the system in use leading up to the crash.
The verbal report from the driver was difficult to understand but Rivians takeaway from the incident is that the vehicle was in the left lane with ACC activated when the lane ended. The driver admitted that they did not react to the lane ending in time and the vehicle impacted the center divider with the side of the vehicle. Damage to the vehicle is unknown but the customer reported that the airbags deployed and that the vehicle had to be towed.",

The entire time I was doing one under the speed limit or the speed limit. I was in the left-hand lane going east. The Volvo was in pilot assist mode or at least I was under the impression that it was in pilot mode and I was briefly, looking at the central infotainment screen with one eye, while the other eye was on the road when the car passed that median on the left side of the vehicle instead of following the road to the right, the car veered to the left or kept going straight depending on your perspective by the time that I realized which was pretty much instantly that the car was not acting properly, I wrestled the steering wheel to the right, but it was not in time to prevent the vehicle from striking a oncoming car. This oncoming car was the Mazda, which I struck with the front left corner of the Volvo hit the Mazda front left corner which bounced the Volvo into the other opposing traffic vehicle, a Honda, which was in the right lane, causing minor damage to the Honda. At this point the vehicle came to arrest in front of the sidewalk . Note that the road was clear it was sunny, and the road markings were highly visible. The driver of the Mazda was injured mildly from his airbag. The driver of the Honda was injured, and myself was also uninjured.""
Volvo Car Review:  We are unable to determine if Pilot Assist was engaged. ACC was on and engaged. Volvo Car review of the incident: The lane markings disappeared due to the intersection at the same time the road bends. The driver failed to monitor the Pilot Assist through the intersection and provide the correct directional input to the vehicle. The driver failed to maintain the correct lane and crossed into oncoming traffic and stuck the vehicle driving westbound. Pilot Assist might deactivate automatically and resumes without prior notice. This is not a collision avoidance system. The driver is always responsible and must intervene if the system fails to interpret how the lanes go due to lack of road line markings. Pilot Assist is not to be used in intersections. Statement from the Customer: I was briefly, looking at the central infotainment screen The driver was distracted just before the accident and wasnt actively monitoring the road conditions or the Pilot Assist system that always requires driver attention and hands on steering wheel.",

I wasn't sure if the cruise control was still on so I returned my foot to the accelerator and tried to get back into the right lane (so as not to hit the k-rail). I think I probably over corrected a bit and veered slightly into the left-hand lane but then I felt the car try to fully jerk us into that left lane. At that point, I lost control of the car as the back started fishtailing."" The driver also noted that ""I am a petite person, with minimal upper body strength, so I had a really hard time trying to control the heft of the vehicle as it was trying to veer into different lanes"". According to the customer report the driver was taken to the hospital and diagnosed with a strained left shoulder and the other 2 occupants, both adults, were not injured.
Update: On January [XXX], 2024, at 10:33:20 a.m. PST, the subject vehicle was traveling south on [XXX] at 77 mph with Rivians Level 2 ADAS feature, Highway Assist (HWA), engaged. 25 seconds later, at 10:33:45 a.m. the vehicle notified the driver through a message on the driver display that their lane was merging ahead. 19 seconds later, at 10:34:04 a.m. PST, after no intervention from the driver, HWA disengaged because the subject vehicle moved out of its ODD as a result of insufficient highway markings.  At that same time, 10:34:04 a.m., the driver received audio and visual alerts to take over control of the subject vehicle through in-vehicle messaging. At this time the system did not detect hands on the wheel. Less than one second later, at 10:34:05 a.m., the driver put their hands back on the wheel and retook control but input a significant steering angle while still at a high rate of speed (75.4 mph) that started a loss of control. This steering input was not a result of the HWA feature, but an overcorrection by the driver. Over the next nine seconds, from 10:34:05 to 10:34:14 a.m., the driver steered the vehicle to both the left and right trying to regain control, they also applied both the brake and accelerator pedals at various times, sometimes simultaneously, until the vehicle departed the roadway and impacted the side barrier at 10:34:14 a.m. PST, causing damage to the right side of the subject vehicle and deploying the side airbags.",
