The eBike laterally impacted the Zoox vehicle's right front fender and body side, then the cyclist impacted the right front body of the Zoox vehicle. The Zoox vehicle then came to a full stop. The cyclist then rode over to the sidewalk and remained briefly stopped on the sidewalk before getting back on the eBike and riding away.

May's vehicle was traveling at approximately 20 MPH in a residential neighborhood, and was approximately 1m left of lane center when a black vehicle exited a driveway on the right from behind a fence, facing the road and May's vehicle. This vehicle did not slow down or stop until entering into the roadway and collided with the May vehicle's right side. AVO attempts to swerve to the left but is unable to avoid a collision. 
The primary factor that led to the collision was the other vehicles action proceeding without the right-of-way into the side of the May vehicle. Upon further inspection, it was determined that we did not predict this collision until it was too late to avoid it even by veering. The velocity of the other vehicle was underestimated and was largely given only yield policies as having the most significant likelihood. There is some room for improvement in our response, which we plan to implement in future software releases, namely, an emergency veer policy must exist that is capable of moving quickly and far enough to possibly avoid the collision, more accurate reporting of velocity for slow-moving agents, estimate acceleration when assessing risk, improvements to predictions of the probability of an agent yielding, and adjusting our risk assessment so that it is heading dependent and more risk would be associated with passing close in front of another vehicle.",,38.0138934,-122.1338674

Shortly after the pedestrians exited their vehicles, an SUV that had been stopped behind the Waymo AV passed the Waymo AV on the left followed by a passenger car that had been stopped behind the SUV. As the passenger car initiated its passing maneuver, a heavy truck passing the scene in the left lane made contact with the drive side of the passenger car.

On February [XXX], 2024 at 2:34 PM PT a Waymo Autonomous Vehicle (Waymo AV) operating in San Francisco, California was in a collision involving a bicyclist on [XXX] at [XXX].
The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The cyclist had entered the 4-way stop intersection without stopping or yielding. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and the bicyclist reported minor injuries and damage to their bicycle. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear, resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

The Waymo AV was traveling westbound on [XXX] and came to a stop at a 4-way stop sign intersection at [XXX]. When it was the Waymo AVs turn at the intersection, the Waymo AV entered the intersection to proceed straight. At this point, a delivery truck traveling eastbound on [XXX] was already in the middle of the intersection (the delivery truck arrived at its stop sign first and proceeded into the intersection before the Waymo AV). As the Waymo AV passed the rear of the delivery truck, an occluded bicyclist who was traveling behind the delivery truck became visible and was making a sharp left turn onto northbound [XXX], in front of the Waymo AVs path. The Waymo AV detected the bicyclist, applied heavy braking, but was unable to avoid contact with the bicyclist before coming to a full stop. 
At the time of the impact, the Waymo AVs Level 4 ADS was engaged in autonomous mode. The Waymo AV sustained minor body damage, and to our knowledge, the bicyclist reported only minor injuries. The Waymo AV remained stopped in the intersection for approximately one minute, and after the path was clear resumed driving for a short period of time. The Waymo AV was then returned to the scene by one of Waymos roadside assistance specialists. The Waymo AV did not require towing and was returned to the depot in manual mode.

As always, there were two safety drivers in the car. Traffic was moving in all four lanes at or near the speed limit. The Ghost vehicle was in the right-middle lane. Another vehicle (the ""lead"" car) entered into the Ghost car's lane from the right. While there were numerous vehicles ahead of the Ghost car before that vehicle entered the lane, the lead vehicle blocked the view of the lane before it. Throughout the incident, traffic in the other three lanes continued at a steady pace.
When the lead vehicle entered into the lane ahead of the Ghost car, the Ghost car applied the brakes to accommodate the intrusion and then continued to match the speed of the lead car. The lead car suddenly slammed the brakes. The Ghost car followed suit, reducing its speed from 19 mps (42.5 mph) to 4.7 mps (10.5 mph) within the next three seconds. The Ghost car was able to match the rapid speed reduction of the lead car and avoid contact.
The driver following the Ghost car was not able to respond as quickly as the Ghost ADS. When the following driver began to apply the brakes, the car was about five meters behind and was traveling at 6.5 mps. At the point of impact, the Ghost vehicle was traveling at 4.78 mps (10.7 mph), matching the lead car. There were no injuries. The vehicles suffered only cosmetic damage, the drivers exchanged information, and the Ghost safety drivers returned to home base in conventional mode.",,37.3361663,-121.890591
